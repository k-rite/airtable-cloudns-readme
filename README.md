- Troubleshooting
    - Record isn't added?
        - Checkout what console log mentioned, It can be unwanted space somewhere in records, incorrect record value.
    - It stopped adding records!
        - Don't worry, Just wait for it to respond, Give it 5mins so it can resolve on it's own.
        - If there's a bulk record addition, then it takes record one at a time so it will eventually add that record too!
        - Make sure "Console log" is empty and API Trigger is tick marked.
    - Unwanted Record is added
        - Once API is triggered and values provide in feild are correct then it will add that record.
        Any change after that will not change the prev added record, It will be added again as a new record.
